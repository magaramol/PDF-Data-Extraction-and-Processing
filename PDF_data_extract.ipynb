        "# PDF Table Extraction from MHA Website Using Camelot\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on extracting table data from Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) PDFs using **Camelot**. These PDFs contain structured data in table format, and **Camelot** is ideal for extracting such tabular data accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Camelot-Based Table Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Download PDFs**: Automatically download PDF files from the MHA website using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
        "- **Extract Tables**: Use **Camelot** to extract tables from the PDFs, especially from PDFs containing structured tabular data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Table Extraction**: Extracts tables from each PDF file and combines the data into a pandas dataframe for further analysis.\n",
        "- **Text Extraction**: Additionally, extracts introductory text from the first page using **PDFplumber**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Download PDFs from MHA Website**:\n",
        "   We use `BeautifulSoup` to extract links to the PDF files on the MHA website, and `requests` is used to download them.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Table Extraction Using Camelot**:\n",
        "   **Camelot** is used to extract tables from the PDF files, converting the data into a pandas dataframe. The data is then cleaned and structured appropriately.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Data Combination**:\n",
        "   Both text and table data are extracted and combined into a structured dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "Install the required Python libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "!pip install pdfplumber\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The script processes:\n",
        "- Downloads PDFs.\n",
        "- Extracts tables using **Camelot** and combines them into a pandas dataframe.\n",
        "- Extracts introductory text using **PDFplumber** for additional context.\n",

The focus is on extracting simple text from the PDFs, particularly from the first page, which typically contains important information like the title.\n",
